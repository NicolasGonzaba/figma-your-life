Figma your life 

I used html and CSS to make a website about a brief summary of my life, originally drafted in figma. It consists of 3 pages which all link to each other

Person who Peer Reviewed your assignment: Vanessa Acuna ( The webpage looks great! I loved that the pictures were personalized.)
